The shellcode module.

This module contains functions for generating shellcode.

It is organized first by architecture and then by operating system.

Example:

    >>> print shellcraft.i386.nop()
        nop
    >>> print shellcraft.i386.linux.sh()
        /* Set syscall number, clear edx */
        push 11
        pop eax
        cdq
    ...
