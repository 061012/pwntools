Have you ever thought:

"Gee, I wish I knew what the ip-adresses of this box is.
 I have shell on the server, but I cannot access /proc"

Well, you're in luck. This program tries to bind to every
ip to see if it is available locally. This if course takes
some time (depending on the speed of the server).

Some quick'n'dirty benchmarks:

On a 2011 Thinkpad X220 (amd64): <10 minutes
On a 2005 Mac mini (powerpc): <1 hour

Compile with:
    gcc [optmization_flags] ipbrute.c -static -o ipbrute

Suggested flags for x86:
    -O3 -march=native -mtune=native


The file better.c is how it really should be done, in case
it is possible. It does more or less the same but using IOCTL
instead of brute force.
