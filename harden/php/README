PHP hardening
=============

Automatic hardening of PHP-services is currently done by:

    - Patching the php.ini file to set sane defaults
        - Turning safe mode on
        - Limiting the directories that allow execution
        - Restricting includes (also remote ones)
        - Disable all functions that are not used by the service
        - Preventing all error messages
        - Setting httponly on cookies

    - Automatically add PHPIDS before any script
